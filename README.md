v1 of my 'Rock, Paper or Scissors' game!
Overall, not bad. I'm happy with the work I've done and the code works as intended with no hiccups.
Apart from UI, which will hopefully be sorted out soon enough, I would like to further improve this code by not counting rounds that resulted with a tie in overall round count.
This code, currently (on February 10th, 2022), increments round counter regardless of the outcome.
